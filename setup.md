## Software Requirements

## XAMPP

You will need to install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to complete these lessons. XAMPP provides a quick and easy way to setup a local web server on your computer with PHP and MariaDB (a fork of MySQL). 

## Alternatives: SQLite and SqliteOnline

### SQLite

This step is optional. If you are completing the tutorial with XAMPP, you won't need to install SQLite separately. 

#### Linux and Mac OS x

SQLite command line tools come preinstalled on Linux and Mac OS x.

In order to check they are available type `sqlite3` at the terminal command line. To exit type `.exit`.

#### Windows

On Windows download the [Windows Installer](https://github.com/swcarpentry/windows-installer/releases/download/v0.3/SWCarpentryInstaller.exe)
Copy the file to a directory and open the directory using the windows command line. Type `sqlite3`.

For a more detailed explanation see this [tutorial](http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/).

### SqliteOnline

This step is optional. If you are completing the tutorial with DB Browser for SQLite, you won't need to use SqliteOnline separately. If you are experiencing trouble with DB Browser for SQLite and/or SQLite or if you would like to run SQL commands online via a browser (nothing to install), then visit [https://sqliteonline.com/](https://sqliteonline.com/).
