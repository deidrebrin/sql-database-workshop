## Controlled vocabularies and thesauri

Relational databases allow you to leverage your normalized fields to make data entry a lot more efficient (i.e. faster and with less errors). One such way is through **controlled vocabularies**â€”lists of values that may be entered into a field. Vocabularies allow you to quickly update all entries if you need to change a term, quickly add translations of terms to build in some multilingual support, reduce typos and errors in entering data (drop down lists, select boxes, etc). 

**Thesauri** are great for humanists and the types of data we frequently work with in our careers. Thesauri provide records of defined terms with alternate spellings, translations, and frequently sources. Certain terms may have multiple spellings depending on conventions but a thesaurus allows data referencing the same term to be understood as the same. They can also be incorporated into search tools so a record comes up regardless of the spelling in the search.
